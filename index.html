            <h1>The History of Marquees</h1>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marquees. They're elegant, sophisticated, stylish. They lend protection and a feeling of opulence to any outdoor event. But what do we know about the history of the famous marquee?
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of the term, like with much in the field of etymology, is peppered with both certainties and uncertainties. It seems that the term “marquise” in reference to a large tent - specifically, a tent which had linen canopy placed over it, which distinguished it from other tents (it was often used by military officers in order to distinguish it from the tents of other soldiers - has French roots dating back to the 1680s.
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many claim that the first recorded use of the term in American English dates back only as far as 1912; others say that the term was used in English for hundreds of years before this, also in the seventeenth century. The English seemed to think that “marquise” - pronounced “mar-KEEZ” - was a plural term, and that the pronunciation “mar-KEE” referred to one such tent. Hence the word as we know it today - marquee!
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a canopy to complement a tent or outside area dates back much farther than the 1680s, of course; we know that they were used by many peoples throughout history, including nomads and Roman soldiers - but they didn't seem to have a specific name until the seventeenth century. Marquees began to see more use away from battlefields, and they became known to many members of the public as light, temporary structures used to protect people from the elements during special events such as balls or banquets. This, of course, gave them a very “upper class”, affluent feels - something that is still felt today, especially with the luxury marquees you can get!
